# Sentiments-Analysis-using-Tensor-Flow

In this project, I have predicted the sentiments whether it is positive or it is negative.
with the help of tensor flow and Natural Language processing , I have used in it RNN and LSTM technique to predict the sentiments if it is above 0.5 then it is positive and it is below 0.5, then it is negative sentiments.
